Using advanced genetic engineering, they were able to create a group of soldiers who were physically superior to any other in the galaxy. However, the scientists soon realized that they had created a powerful weapon without a clear purpose. They decided to set the clones free, hoping that they would find their own way in the galaxy. The clones, now free from their masters, began to explore the galaxy. They quickly discovered that their unique abilities made them valuable assets in the various conflicts and wars that plagued the galaxy. They were in high demand as mercenaries and soldiers for hire, and soon formed their own private military company known as Jotunn Interstellar. Under the banner of Jotunn Interstellar, the Clone Army continued to hone their skills and build their reputation as the most effective and deadly soldiers in the galaxy. They fought in countless battles and conflicts, always on the side of the highest bidder."

The resulting radiation and toxins rendered the planet virtually uninhabitable. But the survivors were not willing to give up on their home. They developed advanced environmental suits that allowed them to venture out into the toxic wasteland that their world had become. As they adapted to their new way of life, the Zaunites also developed a strong sense of self-reliance and a fierce independence. They believed that they had been abandoned by the rest of humanity and were determined to survive on their own terms. But this isolationist mindset also led to the rise of a criminal underworld within Zaun. The harsh living conditions and lack of outside support meant that many turned to illicit means to survive. Eventually, a powerful criminal corporation known as Zaun was founded, which controlled much of the city's illegal activities."

As resources grew scarce, some began to advocate for a more authoritarian approach to governance, arguing that a strong central authority was needed to ensure their survival. Over time, this view gained traction, and a powerful military leader emerged to take control of what remained of the Human civilization. Under his guidance, the remnants were united into a new entity - the Jotunn Imperium - with a focus on military might and the expansion of their territory."

However, their world was invaded by a brutal and oppressive regime that sought to enslave the Soth and exploit their resources. In the face of this aggression, a group of Soth warriors banded together to form a secret order known as the Soth Empire. The Soth Empire quickly gained a reputation for their ruthless tactics and cunning strategies. They struck from the shadows, using guerilla tactics and covert operations to weaken their enemies and gain the upper hand. Eventually, the Soth Empire rose to become the ruling government of their world, with their leaders using their dark powers to maintain their grip on power."

While on a mission to expand the Roman Empire's territory, the Legion found themselves stranded on an alien world, cut off from the rest of humanity and facing a hostile environment that tested their skills and endurance to their limits. The planet was teeming with alien life, some of which were incredibly aggressive and posed a constant threat to the Legion's survival. The Romans fought bravely, but their numbers dwindled with every passing day, as they struggled to adapt to the harsh conditions and unfamiliar enemies. 
		
		As the years went by, the Legion became increasingly xenophobic, viewing all non-humans with suspicion and hostility. Their bitter experiences with war and struggle had left them scarred and paranoid, and they began to see the galaxy as a dangerous and unforgiving place. Now, as they venture forth into the stars once more, the Lost Legion carries with them their deep-seated distrust of all aliens. They are fiercely protective of their own, and will not hesitate to use their battle-hardened skills to defend themselves from any perceived threats."
